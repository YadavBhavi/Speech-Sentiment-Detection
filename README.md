# Speech-Sentiment-Detection
Automatic Speech Recognition - Course Project <br />
Supervisor = Prof Preethi Jyothi <br />
Dataset = HyperValleyBank <br />
-> Implemented a speech sentiment detection model using the pre-trained SpeechBrain CRDNN model <br />
-> Achieved an accuracy of 78% by fine-tuning the encoder of the pre-trained model within few epochs only <br />
